TODO:
FIX TIME SCALE
SLOWING DOWN GAME


TODO PERFORMANCE:
Use Profiling Tools: Python provides a built-in module called cProfile that can help you identify the parts of your code that are taking the most time to execute. This can help you focus your optimization efforts where they will have the most impact.
Optimize Collision Detection: In your Entities.py file, you're checking for collisions between entities and every other entity in the game. This can be quite expensive, especially as the number of entities increases. Consider using a spatial partitioning data structure like a quadtree or a grid to reduce the number of collision checks you need to perform.
Optimize Rendering: In your Game.py file, you're rendering every entity in the game, regardless of whether it's on-screen or not. Consider implementing a system that only renders entities that are within the viewport.
Use Pygame's Dirty Rectangles System: Pygame has a system called "dirty rectangles" that allows you to update only the parts of the screen that have changed since the last frame, rather than redrawing the entire screen every frame. This can significantly improve rendering performance.
