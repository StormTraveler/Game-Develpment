Optimize Collision Detection: In your Entities.py file, you're checking for collisions between entities and every other entity in the game. This can be quite expensive, especially as the number of entities increases. Consider using a spatial partitioning data structure like a quadtree or a grid to reduce the number of collision checks you need to perform.
Optimize Rendering: In your Game.py file, you're rendering every entity in the game, regardless of whether it's on-screen or not. Consider implementing a system that only renders entities that are within the viewport.
